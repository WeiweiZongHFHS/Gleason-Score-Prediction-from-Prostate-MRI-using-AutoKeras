# Gleason-Score-Prediction-from-Prostate-MRI-using-AutoKeras
### This project aims to read from prostate MRI and make predictions on clinical significance of potential lesions. To aid in the ultimate goal of clinical deployment, we trained from a public dataset and tested on 40 patients from our own institute. Note that the testing cohort was generated from two scanners and imaging parameters for the training and testing images are very different which adds more bias of visual effect (usually the contrast of lesion and the surrounding normal tissues) to images even of the same modality type.  We hope by solving the domain drift problem as one of the obstacles to the challenge of generalization, our method can be adopted in many healthcare systems. 
### Another well-known challenge lies in explainability of the AI model. We adopted the Grad-CAM to show the saliency map. We also outputted the predication probability made by the model. By assigning the probability scores to two consecutive slices, our method is capable of highlighting the most suspicious slices out of the whole sequence, so as to save time for the clinicians. 
### In particular, inspired by a former team member, we trained the central gland and peripheral zone separately since these two sub-regions look at different traits when it comes to diagnosis. The trained PZ detector and CG detector generalize well on the unseen testing cohort and are able to raise the alert for lesions on both PZ and CG.
